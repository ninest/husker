## Freshmen housing

Freshmen housing is assigned before the Fall semester, and doesn't change until after the Spring semester. For example, if you were assigned to be in White Hall as a freshman, you will stay in White Hall for the Fall and Spring semester.

Freshmen may be assigned [traditional](/house#traditional) (like White Hall) or [suite-style](/house#suite) dorms. 

### NUin

NUin students will stay abroad their first semester (Fall semester), then move to campus in the Spring semester. They may be assigned to [traditional](/house#traditional) dorms, [suite-style](/house#suite) dorms, or event [apartments](/house#apartment).

Before the end of the NUin semester, a preference form is released where you rate your preference between traditional, suite-style, and apartments. The earlier you **accepted your NUin offer**, the better your chances of getting your desired housing are. If you accepted your NUin offer and confirmed your location the day the locations were released, you have a much better chance of getting assigned your first choice of housing.

## FAQ

### In a double/triple, who gets which bed?

Beds are not assigned, so it's first-come first-serve. You may want to talk to your roommate(s) about this first though.

### Am I allowed to stay on campus over the winter?

For upperclassment, yes if you have a [coninuing contract](https://www.northeastern.edu/housing/winter-break/).

For freshmen, it depends. Please [contact housing](http://localhost:3000/contacts).

### How do I make a work request if I am not on campus?

If you are not connected to NUWave, [connect to the VPN](https://vpn.northeastern.edu/global-protect/getsoftwarepage.esp) to make a work request.

### Are LED lights allowed?

Decorative lights are not allowed in traditional and suite-style dorms (See [Room Policies > Electrical Appliances](https://www.northeastern.edu/housing/room-regulations/)).

However, students bring them anyway and remove them before RA checks.

### How many guests can I bring?

Up to three guests at a time, and they may stay up to three consecutive nights.
