## Contributing a link

All links on the [main page](/) must be commonly used links directly related to Northeastern. Apps or social media-related links should be added to their own page (see sections below).

1. Open the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EpqttYamRgsOIj84_t19SymIuXhD1fgbg6EG1zIoMJM/edit#gid=1558207367)
2. Find the appropriate category and navigate to that sheet via the bottom bar
3. Make a comment in the sheet with the name of resource, a URL, and a short description if required

## Contributing other resources

To contribute to other pages (such as the [apps](/apps) page), you may either open an issue or pull request on [ninest/huskinfo](https://github.com/ninest/huskinfo) on GitHub.

If you are [opening an issue](https://github.com/ninest/huskinfo/issues), please include the following:

- App name
- Short description
- Website (and setup) URL
- Android and iOS URL

If you are opening a pull request, the Markdown file to edit is [`content/guides/apps/index.md`](https://github.com/ninest/huskinfo/blob/main/content/guides/apps/index.md).
