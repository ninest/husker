## Build setup

Clone or fork the repository, then run the commands to start the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

To build and serve the website, run

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```

### Hosting

The game is hosted with Vercel. To host a debug version of the app, run

```
vc
```

To host the production version of the app, run

```
vc --prod
```

If you're getting errors with `mdx-bundler`, or TailwindCSS styles aren't loading, try `vc --prod --force` to delete the old build cache.
