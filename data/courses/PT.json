Drug classification, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, drug interactions, and common side effects are brought into the clinical perspective of patient management. Explores recognition of expected drug effects, side effects, idiosyncratic reactions, and signs of abuse or nonadherence. Along with PT 5140, emphasizes the therapist’s proper incorporation of pharmacotherapeutic knowledge into patient assessment, differential diagnosis, and design of treatment regimens."
