Students form teams and are assigned their design project and faculty adviser. Projects can be industrially, departmentally, or externally sponsored. Students are expected to communicate with their faculty adviser, course coordinator, and sponsor using the Internet, teleconferencing, and other electronic methods. Topics include project management, ethics, cost analysis, Internet and library research methods, and engineering codes and standards. Students prepare written reports and make oral presentations. Students are expected to complete a thorough state-of-the-art report on their problem and a problem statement with specifications and requirements.",

    "description": "Continues MEIE 4701. Students are expected to apply engineering principles acquired throughout their undergraduate academic and co-op experiences to the design of a system, component, or process. Each project includes the development and use of design methodology, formulation of design problem statements and specifications, consideration of alternative solutions, feasibility considerations, and detailed system descriptions. Projects include realistic constraints such as economic factors, safety, reliability, maintenance, aesthetics, ethics, and political and social impact. Students make oral presentations on their results in a series of design reviews. Students document their solutions using a written report that includes an executive summary. A working prototype or simulation, as appropriate, of their solution is required to complete the course.",
