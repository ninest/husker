    "description": "Studies what leadership is; why it is so powerful; and how applying leadership knowledge, skills, and abilities increase marketability, job performance, potential, and career advancement. Offers students an opportunity to learn what attributes provide the confidence and ability to influence others in the workplace and beyond to achieve personal goals and desired outcomes. After completing the experiential interaction in a classroom setting, participants work through self-directed modules during co-op to increase responsibility and credibility and enhance the overall co-op experience.Upon completion of modules, participants present to Gordon Institute cadre on their experiences.",
