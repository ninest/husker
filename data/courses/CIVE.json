    "description": "Explores the networks that underpin the very existence of cities: our urban infrastructure. Designed as a grand tour of the engineering marvels that exist beneath our feet but whose operation is critical to urban dwellers, using Boston as our guide. Offers students an opportunity to study a new infrastructure system, first by learning and discussing the engineering principles behind its design and operation, and then by experiencing our local infrastructure through visits to local operation centers, city officials, and private contractors that manage and maintain them. Topics include transportation, energy, telecommunications, water and wastewater, food processing and distribution, and waste management. Explores how our infrastructure is interconnected and how this leads both to resilience and to fragility in the face of natural and anthropogenic disruptions.",
